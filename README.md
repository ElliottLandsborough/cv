# Elliott Landsborough

### Intro

I have worked as a PHP developer for over six years (Laravel 5, Symfony) and more recently as a modern JavaScript developer (ES6+, React, Vue). Having worked with most popular Linux distributions as far back as Etch, I am very proficient at the ‘ops’ side too - both in Linux setup and more modern technologies like Docker. I have extensive experience in HTML, CSS and ES5/jQuery too.

I am passionate about keeping up with the latest technologies outside of the workplace and I regularly contribute to open source projects along with maintaining my own.

I consider myself to be a fast learner and I strive to be a polyglot. I enjoy scripting in python and have used node for personal projects but have not yet had the opportunity to use either of them in a professional capacity.
